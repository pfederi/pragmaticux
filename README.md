- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed (mobile menu, decision helper)
- **Accessible Design**: Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **Performance**: Optimized loading and rendering
- **User-Centered**: Focus on user needs and goals
- **Consistent Design Language**: Unified color scheme, typography, and spacing

## 📦 Deployment

This Next.js application is optimized for deployment on Vercel and other modern hosting platforms.

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy is using Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository in Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build

Or use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Other Platforms

The application can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js:

- **Netlify**: Connect your Git repository, Netlify will auto-detect Next.js
- **AWS Amplify**: Connect repository, configure build settings
- **Railway**: Connect repository, Railway auto-detects Next.js
- **Any Node.js hosting**: Run `npm run build` and deploy the `.next` folder

### Build Configuration

The project uses Next.js 15 with:
- App Router (app directory)
- Server Components by default
- Static generation where possible
- Dynamic routes for principle pages

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Next.js 15 Compatibility

This project uses Next.js 15 features:
- `params` in dynamic routes are now Promises (must be awaited)
- Server Components by default
- Improved TypeScript support

### TypeScript

All components and utilities are fully typed. The project includes:
- Type definitions for principles and decision tree
- Strict type checking enabled
- Type-safe data imports

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom color scheme using CSS variables
- Responsive breakpoints: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`
- Dark mode support (class-based)
